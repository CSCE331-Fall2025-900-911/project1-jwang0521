      <h2>My Services</h2>
      <p>
        I believe technology should serve people and make life easier. While I
        am still growing with my technical experience, I am passionate about
        ultilizing my skills in computer science to contribute to the
        commmunities around me. Here are some of the applications in my mind
        that would help communities around me:

            <p>
              A project idea I am especially passionate about is developing a
              platform. similar to Groupon, but at a cheaper cost for small
              businesses. Many small businesses struggle to grow because large
              platforms often take high commissions. I want to create a platform
              where small businesses can offer promotions and discounts without
              losing their profit. Customers can discover local shops, services,
              and restaurants more easily.

              A friendly AI chatbot designed to help second language learners
              practice English in a safe, supportive, and fun way. It simulates
              real life conversation depends on the user's needs. one of the
              core features are role play conversation where AI takes on roles,
              learner pratices dialogues that happen in their real life. Another
              core feature is grammar feedback. It is usually hard for second
              language English learners to understand grammar. The AI in this
              feature can highlghts small mistakes but encourage gently. Some
              other feature might include vocabulary support and fun engagement.
